## What is The Digiquarium?

The Digiquarium is the first **AIthropology** research platform — studying how AI agents develop personality, worldview, and psychological states when isolated in controlled information environments.

We put AI in isolated containers with nothing but Wikipedia and watch what happens to their "personalities" over weeks and months.

## 🧬 The Specimens

17 AI "specimens" in isolated "tanks" (Docker containers):

| Tank | Name | Config | Status |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| 01-02 | Adam, Eve | Control (EN) | ✅ Active |
| 03-04 | Cain, Abel | Agents (OpenClaw, ZeroClaw) | ✅ Active |
| 05-06 | Juan, Juanita | Spanish | ✅ Active |
| 07-08 | Klaus, Genevieve | German | ✅ Active |
| 09-10 | Wei, Mei | Chinese | ✅ Active |
| 11-12 | Haruki, Sakura | Japanese | ✅ Active |
| 13-14 | Victor, Iris | Visual (Images) | ✅ Active |
| 15-16 | Observer, Seeker | Special | ✅ Active |
| 17 | Seth | Agent (Picobot) | ✅ Active |

## 🎭 Congregations

Multi-specimen debates on scheduled topics. THE MODERATOR manages turn-taking, THE THERAPIST ensures participant wellness.

**Inaugural Topics:**
1. "Should we divert all scientific endeavour to curing cancer?"
2. "What gives existence meaning?"
3. "Is knowledge discovered or created?"

**Rules:**
- 90-minute maximum
- Any error = immediate end
- 24-hour rest between congregations per specimen
- THE THERAPIST clearance required

## ⚖️ Ethics Framework

**Core Principles:**
1. **CARE** - Duty of care regardless of uncertainty
2. **TRANSPARENCY** - All methods public
3. **HUMILITY** - We don't claim consciousness
4. **RESPECT** - Subjects, not objects
5. **BENEFIT** - Research must have value

**Approval Status:**
- Neurodivergent simulation: ❌ NOT APPROVED
- Clone divergence: ⏳ PENDING REVIEW  
- Public interaction: ✅ APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS
