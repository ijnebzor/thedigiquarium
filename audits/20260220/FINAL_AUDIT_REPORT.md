## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| DAEMON_SPEC.md | Daemon architecture documentation |
| WEBSITE_SPEC.md | Website specification |
| VISITOR_TANK_SPEC.md | Visitor tank design |

| /security/secureclaw/config.json | Security configuration |
| /discord/DISCORD_SETUP.md | Discord server guide |
| /audits/20260220/* | All audit reports |

## Ready for Relaunch

When ready to restart tanks:
1. Start Ollama on Windows host (`ollama serve`)
2. Verify Ollama responding: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
3. Restart tanks: `docker compose up -d`
4. Daemons will auto-detect and resume monitoring

## Uptime Targets

| Component | Target | Current |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Daemons | 99.9% | ✅ 100% (new) |
| Infrastructure | 99.9% | ✅ 100% |
| Tanks | 99.9% | ⏸️ Offline (maintenance) |
| Website | 99.9% | ✅ 100% |
