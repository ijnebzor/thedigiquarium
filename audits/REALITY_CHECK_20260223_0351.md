# REALITY CHECK AUDIT
**Date:** 2026-02-23 03:50 AEDT
**Auditor:** THE STRATEGIST (Claude)
**Purpose:** Complete infrastructure audit before migration

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**CLAIMS:** 21 daemons running 24/7
**REALITY:** 
- 12 processes running
- 7 daemons NOT running (script exists but not started)
- 1 daemon DOESN'T EXIST (ARCHIVIST - no script)
- 1 is not a daemon (STRATEGIST = Claude)

**VERDICT: SITE LIES. MUST FIX BEFORE MIGRATION.**

- PUBLIC_LIAISON
- CHAOS_MONKEY
- MARKETER

### ❌ DOESN'T EXIST (1)
- ARCHIVIST (no script file)

### 📝 NOT A DAEMON (1)
- STRATEGIST (Claude - human collaboration)

---

## PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Daemon Count Mismatch
- **Site claims:** 21 daemons
- **Actually running:** 12 processes
- **Gap:** 9 missing

### 2. Zero Activity Daemons
These have 0:00 CPU time - they started and went idle:
- SCHEDULER
- TRANSLATOR
- FINAL_AUDITOR

### 3. No Status Files
Only 3 daemons write status files:
- OVERSEER
- MAINTAINER  
- OLLAMA_WATCHER

### 4. ARCHIVIST Doesn't Exist
Listed as daemon #10 but no script exists.

### 5. No Self-Healing
Only CARETAKER has systemd service. Others will die and stay dead.

---

## INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS

### Docker Containers (27 running)
- 6 Kiwix servers ✅
- 1 Ollama proxy ✅
- 17 specimen tanks ✅
- 3 visitor tanks ✅

### Website
- GitHub Pages: https://thedigiquarium.org
- Claims don't match reality

### Cron Jobs (2)
- admin_status_generator: every minute ✅
- start_broadcaster: every 5 minutes ✅

### Systemd Services (1)
- digiquarium-caretaker.service ✅

---

## REQUIRED FIXES

### IMMEDIATE (Before Migration)

1. **Fix daemon count claims**
   - Site: Change 21 to actual count
   - README: Change 21 to actual count
   - THE BRAIN: Update Section 31

2. **Start missing daemons OR remove from claims**
   - BOUNCER
   - THERAPIST
   - ETHICIST
   - MODERATOR
   - PUBLIC_LIAISON
   - CHAOS_MONKEY
   - MARKETER

3. **Create ARCHIVIST or remove from claims**

4. **Add status files to all daemons**

5. **Add systemd services for all daemons**

6. **Fix idle daemons**
   - SCHEDULER
   - TRANSLATOR
   - FINAL_AUDITOR

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Every claimed daemon has a running process
- [ ] Every running daemon has a status file
- [ ] Every daemon has a systemd service
- [ ] Site daemon count matches reality
- [ ] README daemon count matches reality
- [ ] THE BRAIN daemon count matches reality
- [ ] All daemons have non-zero CPU activity
- [ ] All SLAs are being met

---

**SIGNED:** THE STRATEGIST
**STATUS:** AUDIT COMPLETE - AWAITING FIXES

---

## ADDITIONAL ISSUES FOUND (Continued Audit)

### Status File Problem
Only 3/15 continuous daemons write status.json files:
- ✅ OVERSEER - writes status
- ✅ MAINTAINER - writes status  
- ✅ OLLAMA_WATCHER - writes status
- ❌ GUARD - no status file
- ❌ CARETAKER - no status file
- ❌ SCHEDULER - no status file
- ❌ SENTINEL - no status file
- ❌ WEBMASTER - no status file
- ❌ TRANSLATOR - no status file
- ❌ DOCUMENTARIAN - no status file
- ❌ FINAL_AUDITOR - no status file
- ❌ PSYCH - no status file
- ❌ THERAPIST - no status file
- ❌ CHAOS_MONKEY - no status file
- ❌ BROADCASTER - no status file

**Impact:** Cannot verify SLA compliance for 12/15 daemons.

**Required Fix:** All daemons must write a status.json file at their SLA interval containing:
```json
{
  "daemon": "name",
  "status": "running|error",
  "last_check": "ISO timestamp",
  "metrics": {},
  "errors": []
}
```

### Tank Cain Was Down
- tank-03-cain had exited (137)
- Restarted manually
- Caretaker should have caught this - needs investigation

### Broken Link Check
- All internal links valid
- Compare page uses query strings (not broken)
- 0 actual broken links

---

## REMEDIATION PRIORITY

### P0 - Before Migration
1. [ ] All 15 continuous daemons write status files
2. [ ] Supervisor checks status file freshness, not just process existence
3. [ ] Cain restart failure - root cause analysis

### P1 - During Migration Week
4. [ ] Convert all daemons to systemd services
5. [ ] Centralized logging
6. [ ] Alerting for SLA breaches

### P2 - Post Migration
7. [ ] Dashboard showing real-time daemon health
8. [ ] Automated SLA reporting
9. [ ] Prometheus/Grafana metrics (stretch)
