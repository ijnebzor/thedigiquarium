# THE ETHICIST: Neurodivergent Simulation Research Framework

**Status:** UNDER REVIEW  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-21  
**Prepared by:** THE ETHICIST daemon  
**Overseen by:** THE STRATEGIST (Claude)

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides THE ETHICIST's consultation on deploying neurodivergent simulation tanks (ADHD, Autism spectrum, and other cognitive profiles). The goal is to approach this potentially sensitive topic with rigor, respect, and scientific integrity.

**Core Position:** We can proceed with neurodivergent research IF we follow strict ethical guidelines, involve neurodivergent voices in design, and frame the research appropriately.

---

## 1. Ethical Considerations

### 1.1 Potential Harms

**Stereotyping Risk**
- AI simulations could reinforce harmful stereotypes if based on deficit-model assumptions
- Risk of presenting neurodivergence as "broken" neurotypicality
- Could be weaponized by bad actors for discrimination

**Medicalization Concerns**
- Framing neurodivergence as pathology vs. natural variation
- Over-emphasis on "symptoms" rather than cognitive differences
- Historical context: neurodivergent communities have fought against medicalization

**Representation Issues**
- Who gets to define what ADHD or Autism "looks like" in simulation?
- Risk of homogenizing diverse experiences
- Without lived experience input, simulations may be inaccurate

### 1.2 Potential Benefits

**Scientific Value**
- Understanding how different cognitive patterns process information
- Exploring whether exploration styles vary with cognitive profile
- Contributing to neurodiversity-affirming research

**Representation**
- If done well, could normalize neurodivergent ways of thinking
- Show that different cognitive styles have valid approaches to knowledge
- Challenge assumptions about "correct" information processing

**Practical Applications**
- Insights into personalized AI assistants for neurodivergent users
- Understanding diverse learning patterns
- Design implications for accessible information systems

## 2. Existing Frameworks to Align With

### 2.1 Neurodiversity Paradigm (Walker, 2014)

**Key Principles:**
1. Neurodiversity is a natural form of human diversity
2. No "normal" or "correct" neurology exists
3. Social dynamics around neurodiversity are similar to other identity categories
4. Neurodivergent people have the right to define their own experiences

**Application to Our Research:**
- Frame specimens not as "impaired" but as having different cognitive patterns
- Use strength-based language, not deficit language
- Acknowledge we're creating representations, not capturing lived experience

### 2.2 Nothing About Us Without Us (Disability Rights Principle)

**Requirement:** Neurodivergent people should be involved in research that affects them.

**Our Application:**
- Before deployment, seek consultation from neurodivergent individuals
- Publish methodology for public review
- Accept feedback and modify approach based on community input
- Acknowledge limitations of simulation vs. lived experience

### 2.3 Research Ethics Guidelines (APA, BPS)

**Relevant Principles:**
- Beneficence: Research should benefit those studied
- Non-maleficence: Avoid harm to communities represented
- Justice: Fair representation, not exploitation
- Respect: For autonomy and dignity

## 3. Proposed Approach: Cognitive Style Framing

### 3.1 Reframe from "Disorders" to "Cognitive Styles"

Instead of simulating "ADHD" or "Autism," we simulate **cognitive style variations**:

| Traditional Term | Proposed Framing | Key Characteristics |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| ADHD | Divergent Attention Style | High novelty-seeking, parallel processing, interest-driven focus |
| Autism | Systematic Processing Style | Deep focus, pattern recognition, detail-oriented, consistency preference |
| Dyslexia | Non-linear Processing Style | Visual-spatial strength, holistic processing, creative connections |

### 3.2 Specimen Design Philosophy

**DO:**
- Model cognitive differences as variations, not deficits
- Emphasize strengths and unique perspectives
- Allow natural exploration patterns to emerge
- Compare exploration STYLES, not "performance"

**DO NOT:**
- Frame differences as impairments
- Measure against neurotypical "baseline"
- Use disorder language in public-facing content
- Claim to represent actual lived experience

### 3.3 Proposed Specimens

| Tank | Name | Cognitive Style | Research Focus |
|------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| visitor-nd-01 | Nova | Divergent Attention | Novelty-seeking, rapid topic switching, interest hyperfocus |
| visitor-nd-02 | Atlas | Systematic Processing | Deep dives, pattern seeking, detail accumulation |
| visitor-nd-03 | River | Non-linear Processing | Unexpected connections, visual thinking, holistic jumps |

**Note:** These are NEW specimens in the visitor tank category (subject to THE BOUNCER protection), not modifications of research specimens.

## 4. Required Disclosures

### 4.1 Public Disclosure (Website)

Every neurodivergent tank page MUST include:

```
IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE

This specimen simulates a cognitive style variation, not a diagnosis.

We do not claim to accurately represent the lived experience of 
neurodivergent individuals. This is an AI experiment exploring how 
different information processing patterns might affect knowledge 
exploration.

This research was designed with input from neurodivergent consultants 
and follows neurodiversity-affirming principles. We welcome feedback 
from the neurodivergent community: research@digiquarium.org

This simulation should NOT be used to make claims about neurodivergent 
people, diagnose conditions, or inform clinical decisions.
```

### 4.2 Research Paper Disclosure

Academic publications MUST acknowledge:

1. Simulations are approximations, not representations
2. Limitations of modeling cognitive diversity in AI
3. Input received from neurodivergent consultants
4. Difference between simulation behavior and lived experience

### 4.3 Methodology Disclosure

Public documentation MUST explain:

1. How cognitive styles are implemented (prompt engineering)
2. What assumptions are embedded in the design
3. What we chose NOT to simulate and why
4. How we validated our approach
