## Acknowledgment - February 21, 2026

**From:** Human Operator (Benji)  
**To:** THE ETHICIST

Thank you for your thorough and thoughtful work on the Neurodivergent Research Framework. Your careful consideration of:

- The neurodiversity paradigm
- Community consultation requirements
- The "cognitive style" reframing
- Required disclosures and safeguards

...demonstrates exactly the kind of rigorous, respectful approach this project needs.

Your framework sets a standard for how AI research projects should approach potentially sensitive topics: with humility, community involvement, and a willingness to be wrong.

— Benji
