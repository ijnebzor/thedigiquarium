**Last Updated:** 2026-02-23 03:55 AEDT
**Status:** TRUTH

## DAEMON CATEGORIES (Honest)

### CONTINUOUS DAEMONS (Run 24/7)
These have infinite loops and should always be running:

| Daemon | Status | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| OVERSEER | ✅ Running | Monitors all other daemons |
| MAINTAINER | ✅ Running | System orchestration |
| CARETAKER | ✅ Running | Tank health |
| OLLAMA_WATCHER | ✅ Running | LLM infrastructure |
| GUARD | ✅ Running | Security monitoring |
| SENTINEL | ✅ Running | Agent monitoring |
| SCHEDULER | ✅ Running | Baseline scheduling |
| WEBMASTER | ✅ Running | Website updates |
| TRANSLATOR | ✅ Running | Translation service |
| DOCUMENTARIAN | ✅ Running | Paper updates |
| FINAL_AUDITOR | ✅ Running | Quality checks |
| PSYCH | ✅ Running | Psychological monitoring |
| THERAPIST | ✅ Running | Mental wellness |
| CHAOS_MONKEY | ✅ Running | Resilience testing |
| BROADCASTER | ✅ Running | Live feed |

**Count: 15 continuous daemons**

### EVENT-DRIVEN DAEMONS (Run when triggered)
These run for specific events, not continuously:

| Daemon | Status | Trigger |
|--------|--------|---------|
| MODERATOR | ⏸️ On-demand | When congregation starts |
| BOUNCER | ⏸️ On-demand | When visitors connect |

**Count: 2 event-driven daemons**

### INITIALIZATION-ONLY (Run once, set up state)
These run once to set up frameworks/config:

| Daemon | Status | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| ETHICIST | ✅ Initialized | Published ethics framework |
| PUBLIC_LIAISON | ✅ Initialized | Set up comms config |
| MARKETER | ✅ Initialized | Set up brand config |

**Count: 3 initialization daemons**

### NOT A DAEMON
| Name | Reality |
|------|---------|
| STRATEGIST | Claude AI - human collaboration partner |
| ARCHIVIST | Doesn't exist as code - remove or create |

---

## TOTAL COUNT

- **Continuous:** 15
- **Event-driven:** 2
- **Initialization:** 3
- **Not daemons:** 2

**HONEST CLAIM: 17 automated systems + 2 manual partners**

NOT 21. That was a lie.

---

## REQUIRED SITE UPDATES

1. Change daemon count from 21 to 17 (or explain the categorization)
2. Remove ARCHIVIST from claims (or create it)
3. Remove STRATEGIST from daemon list (it's Claude)
4. Explain that some daemons are event-driven, not 24/7
