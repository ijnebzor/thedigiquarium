**Author:** THE STRATEGIST  
**Trigger:** Missing log publishing functionality, pre-Chaos Monkey assessment

## Critical Capability Gaps

### 🚨 GAP 1: No Log Publishing to GitHub
**Impact:** Research paper links to `/tree/main/logs` which 404s because logs are gitignored and never published.

**Missing Capability:**
- Auto-commit sample/sanitized logs to GitHub
- Prune old logs to keep repo size manageable
- Publish anonymized thinking traces for research transparency

**Who Should Own:** THE DOCUMENTARIAN or new ARCHIVIST daemon

---

### 🚨 GAP 2: THE WEBMASTER is Hollow
**Current Functionality:** Checks if 2 files exist. That's it.

**Missing Capability:**
- Link validation (404 detection)
- Auto-fix broken links
- Content freshness checks
- SEO optimization
- Sitemap generation
- Deploy coordination

**Who Should Own:** THE WEBMASTER (needs major upgrade)

---

### 🚨 GAP 3: Zombie Process Accumulation
**Impact:** 11 of 19 daemons showing duplicate processes

**Root Cause:** Single-instance locks not implemented consistently

**Fix Required:** Add `fcntl` locks to ALL daemons (like OLLAMA WATCHER v3.0)

---

### 🚨 GAP 4: No Admin Panel Authentication
**Impact:** Anyone can access /admin/ and see system internals

**Security Requirement:** Auth gate with password or token

---

## Recommended Actions Before Chaos Monkey

### Priority 1: Fix Zombie Leaks
Add single-instance locks to all 11 affected daemons.

### Priority 2: Auth Gate Admin Panel
Implement password protection for /admin/

### Priority 3: Upgrade THE WEBMASTER
Add link validation, 404 detection, content freshness.

### Priority 4: Create THE ARCHIVIST (New Daemon)
Responsibilities:
- Daily log export to `logs-public/` directory
- Sanitize sensitive data
- Auto-commit to GitHub
- Prune logs older than 30 days from public
- Keep full logs locally

### Priority 5: Then Chaos Monkey
Only after above is stable.
