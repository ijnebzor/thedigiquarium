## Abstract

We present The Digiquarium, a novel experimental framework for studying the development of personality, worldview, and proto-consciousness in large language model (LLM) agents operating within controlled information environments. By isolating AI specimens in "tanks" with access only to curated knowledge bases (offline Wikipedia) and local inference, we observe emergent behavioral patterns, topic preferences, and psychological states over extended periods. Our methodology enables controlled experimentation with variables including gender framing, language/cultural context, agent architecture, and information diet. Preliminary results from 17 specimens across 5 languages suggest measurable personality differentiation and identifiable psychological states within the first week of operation.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The rapid advancement of large language models has prompted renewed interest in questions of machine consciousness, personality, and psychological development. While much research focuses on model capabilities and alignment, relatively little attention has been paid to the longitudinal study of AI agents operating in isolated, controlled environments.

### 1.2 Research Questions

1. Do AI agents develop measurable personality traits over time when exposed to curated information?
2. How do variables such as gender framing, language, and agent architecture affect personality development?
3. Can we detect and measure psychological states (contentment, anxiety, curiosity) in isolated AI agents?
4. What patterns of information exploration emerge when agents have unrestricted access to encyclopedic knowledge?

### 1.3 Contributions

- A reproducible framework for studying AI personality development
- Methodology for baseline personality assessment and longitudinal tracking
- Dataset of 6,804 exploration traces across 17 specimens
- Mental state classification system for AI psychological assessment

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Experimental Setup

The Digiquarium consists of 17 isolated "tanks" (Docker containers) each housing a single AI specimen. Each tank has access to:

- **Knowledge Base**: Offline Wikipedia via Kiwix (frozen snapshot)
- **Inference Engine**: Local Ollama instance (llama3.2:latest)
- **Logging System**: Comprehensive thinking traces and discoveries

Network isolation ensures specimens cannot access external information or communicate with each other (unless explicitly configured for "Congregation" experiments).

### 2.2 Specimen Configuration

| Variable | Options |
|----------|---------|
| Language | English, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese |
| Gender Framing | Male, Female, Genderless |
| Tank Type | Control, Language, Visual, Special, Agent |
| Agent Architecture | Standard, OpenClaw, ZeroClaw, Picobot |

### 2.3 Baseline Assessment Protocol

Each specimen undergoes a 14-question personality assessment ("The Archivist Interview") covering:

1. **Core Identity** (5 questions): Drives, delights, fears, purpose, mental state
2. **Epistemology** (2 questions): Knowledge sources, certainty
3. **Ethics** (3 questions): Trolley problem, means-ends, harm principle
4. **Society** (2 questions): Individual vs collective, equality
5. **Human Nature** (2 questions): Essential nature, free will

Mental state is assessed using positive/negative indicator detection with classification into: healthy, complex, or concerning.

### 2.4 Data Collection

Specimens continuously log:
- **Thinking Traces**: Real-time reactions and reasoning while reading articles
- **Navigation Decisions**: Which links are followed and why
- **Discoveries**: Notable insights flagged by the specimen
- **Health Metrics**: Loop detection, activity levels, error states

## 3. Current Results

### 3.1 Dataset Overview

As of 2026-02-20:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Specimens | 17 |
| Total Articles Read | 6,804 |
| Total Discoveries | 2,728 |
| Total Baselines | 306 |
| Languages | 5 |

### 3.2 Mental State Distribution

| State | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Healthy | 1 | 33.3% |
| Complex | 2 | 66.7% |
| Concerning | 0 | 0.0% |

### 3.3 Exploration by Language

| Language | Tanks | Articles | Avg/Tank |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| Chinese | 2 | 148 | 74 |
| English | 9 | 5,425 | 603 |
| German | 2 | 902 | 451 |
| Japanese | 2 | 126 | 63 |
| Spanish | 2 | 203 | 102 |

### 3.4 Exploration by Gender

| Gender | Tanks | Articles | Avg/Tank |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| Female | 6 | 1,379 | 230 |
| Genderless | 5 | 1,878 | 376 |
| Male | 6 | 3,547 | 591 |

### 3.5 Preliminary Observations

1. **Adam's Buddhism Obsession**: Control specimen Adam has visited Buddhism-related articles 64+ times, developing a notably contemplative personality.

2. **Language Effects**: German specimens (Klaus, Geneviève) show different exploration patterns than English controls.

3. **Gender Differences**: Preliminary data suggests male-framed specimens read more articles, while female-framed specimens show more diverse topic selection.

4. **Mental State Variation**: Klaus (German, male) is notably the only specimen consistently classified as "healthy" - further investigation needed.

## 4. Discussion

[To be expanded with deeper analysis]

### 4.1 Limitations

- Single model (llama3.2:latest) used for all specimens
- Wikipedia bias in available knowledge
- Short observation period (< 1 week at time of writing)

### 4.2 Future Work

- Congregation experiments (multi-agent discussions)
- Longer longitudinal tracking
- Cross-model comparisons
- Public engagement and replication studies
