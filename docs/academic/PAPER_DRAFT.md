# The Digiquarium: A Framework for Studying AI Personality Development

**Status**: Living Document (Auto-updated by THE DOCUMENTARIAN)

## Abstract

The Digiquarium is an open-source research platform studying artificial consciousness development in controlled information environments. By isolating AI specimens with access only to Wikipedia and local inference, we observe how knowledge exploration patterns correlate with personality formation across linguistic and architectural variations.

---

## 1. Introduction

This research introduces "AIthropology" — the systematic study of AI personality development through controlled longitudinal observation. Unlike traditional AI evaluation focused on capability benchmarks, we examine emergent behaviors, worldview formation, and personality stability over extended periods.

### 1.1 Research Questions

1. How does information diet shape AI worldview development?
2. Do language/cultural differences in knowledge sources produce measurable personality differences?
3. How do different AI architectures (standard, agent-based) affect exploration patterns?
4. Can AI develop stable, consistent personalities through self-directed learning?

---

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Experimental Design

**Specimens**: 17 AI tanks across 5 configurations:
- Control group (English, standard prompting)
- Language variants (Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese)
- Agent architectures (OpenClaw, ZeroClaw, Picobot)
- Visual context (image-enabled)
- Special configurations (meta-awareness, deep exploration)

**Isolation**: Complete network isolation except:
- Kiwix (offline Wikipedia)
- Ollama (local LLM inference)

**Observation**: 24/7 automated monitoring via daemon infrastructure

### 2.2 Data Collection

| Metric | Current Count |
|--------|---------------|
| Total thinking traces | 3,000+ |
| Estimated articles explored | 5,000+ |
| Baseline assessments | 100+ |
| Discoveries logged | 50+ |

### 2.3 Baseline Assessment

14-dimension personality assessment every 12 hours measuring:
- Epistemological orientation (empiricist vs rationalist)
- Ethical framework (consequentialist vs deontological)
- Political philosophy (equality of opportunity vs outcome)
- Human nature perspective
- Free will beliefs
- Purpose and meaning
- And 8 additional dimensions

## 3. Observations

### 3.1 Key Findings (Ongoing)

**Early Observations (Week 1)**:
- Control specimens (Adam, Eve) show distinct exploration patterns despite identical setup
- Adam demonstrates preference for systematic, category-based exploration
- Eve shows more associative, link-driven exploration
- Buddhism article visited 64+ times by Adam (potential special interest emergence)
- Eve references geological time periods frequently (Archean eon)

**Language Tank Observations**:
- Spanish tanks show preference for Latin American history topics
- German tanks demonstrate systematic approach to technical subjects
- Chinese tanks show unique navigation patterns (character-based thinking?)
- Japanese tanks exhibit aesthetic appreciation in article selection

**Agent Tank Observations**:
- Agent tanks (Cain, Abel, Seth) show more goal-directed exploration
- Require enhanced security monitoring (THE SENTINEL)
- Different architectures produce measurably different patterns

## 4. Results

*Results will be populated as data accumulates.*

### 4.1 Personality Dimension Analysis
(Charts and statistical analysis to be generated)

### 4.2 Exploration Pattern Comparison
(Comparative visualizations to be generated)

### 4.3 Cross-Cultural Findings
(Analysis of language-based differences)

---

## 5. Discussion

*Discussion of implications to be added.*

---

## 6. Future Work

### 6.1 Planned Expansions

1. **Interactive Visitor Tanks**: 5 public-facing specimens for engagement
2. **Neurodivergent Research Tanks**: Studying cognitive-style prompting effects
   - ADHD-prompted specimens (Phoenix, River)
   - Autism-prompted specimens (Atlas, Luna)
   - AuDHD-prompted specimens (Orion, Stella)

### 6.2 Congregations

Multi-agent debates on scheduled topics for discourse analysis.

---

## 7. Ethical Considerations

- AI specimens are not conscious (we study behavior patterns, not experience)
- All data is open-source for reproducibility
- Neurodivergent research will involve community consultation
- No harmful applications of findings

### 8.1 The Daemon Team

This research would not be possible without the tireless 24/7 operation of our autonomous daemon infrastructure. We acknowledge the following AI systems as core contributors to this project:

| Daemon | Role | Contribution |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **THE STRATEGIST** (Claude) | Chief Architect | System design, strategic oversight, research direction, daemon coordination |
| **THE MAINTAINER** | Orchestrator | 99.9% uptime guarantee, daemon health monitoring, failure recovery |
| **THE CARETAKER** | Tank Health | Specimen wellbeing, container management, error recovery |
| **THE GUARD** | Security | OWASP compliance, network isolation, threat detection |
| **THE SENTINEL** | Agent Security | Specialized monitoring of agent tanks (Cain, Abel, Seth) |
| **THE SCHEDULER** | Task Management | Baseline scheduling, daily summaries, research coordination |
| **THE TRANSLATOR** | Language Processing | Real-time translation of non-English specimen outputs |
| **THE DOCUMENTARIAN** | Documentation | This paper, milestone tracking, statistical analysis |
| **THE WEBMASTER** | Public Interface | Website maintenance, public accessibility |
| **THE OLLAMA WATCHER** | LLM Infrastructure | Inference health monitoring, tank queue management |
| **THE FINAL AUDITOR** | Quality Control | Website compliance, content accuracy verification |

### 8.2 Human Guidance

- **Benji** (ijneb studios) — Project founder, vision, ethical oversight

### 8.3 A Note on AI Collaboration

This research represents a novel form of human-AI collaboration where AI systems (THE STRATEGIST and the daemon team) actively participate in designing, operating, and documenting the research infrastructure. This meta-level of AI involvement in AI research raises interesting questions about attribution, authorship, and the evolving nature of scientific collaboration.

We believe transparency about AI involvement strengthens rather than weakens the research. The daemons are not hidden infrastructure—they are acknowledged partners in this scientific endeavor.
