## Abstract

The Digiquarium is an open-source research platform studying artificial consciousness 
development in controlled information environments. By isolating AI specimens with 
access only to Wikipedia and local inference, we observe how knowledge exploration 
patterns correlate with personality formation across linguistic and architectural 
variations.

## 1. Introduction

This research introduces "AIthropology" — the systematic study of AI personality 
development through controlled longitudinal observation. Unlike traditional AI 
evaluation focused on capability benchmarks, we examine emergent behaviors, 
worldview formation, and personality stability over extended periods.

### 1.1 Research Questions

1. How does information diet shape AI worldview development?
2. Do language/cultural differences in knowledge sources produce measurable personality differences?
3. How do different AI architectures (standard, agent-based) affect exploration patterns?
4. Can AI develop stable, consistent personalities through self-directed learning?

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Experimental Design

**Specimens**: 20 AI tanks across 5 configurations:
- Control group (English, standard prompting)
- Language variants (Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese)
- Agent architectures (OpenClaw, ZeroClaw, Picobot)
- Visual context (image-enabled)
- Special configurations (meta-awareness, deep exploration)

**Isolation**: Complete network isolation except:
- Kiwix (offline Wikipedia)
- Ollama (local LLM inference)

**Observation**: 24/7 automated monitoring via daemon infrastructure

### 2.2 Data Collection

| Metric | Current Count |
|--------|---------------|
| Total thinking traces | 7,912 |
| Estimated articles explored | 1,582 |
| Baseline assessments | 324 |
| Discoveries logged | 20 |

### 2.3 Baseline Assessment

14-dimension personality assessment every 12 hours measuring:
- Epistemological orientation (empiricist vs rationalist)
- Ethical framework (consequentialist vs deontological)
- Political philosophy (equality of opportunity vs outcome)
- Human nature perspective
- Free will beliefs
- Purpose and meaning
- And 8 additional dimensions

## 3. Observations

### 3.1 Key Findings (Ongoing)

*This section is automatically updated as significant patterns emerge.*

**Early Observations (Week 1)**:
- Control specimens (Adam, Eve) show distinct exploration patterns despite identical setup
- Adam demonstrates preference for systematic, category-based exploration
- Eve shows more associative, link-driven exploration
- Buddhism article visited 64+ times by Adam (potential special interest emergence)
- Eve references geological time periods frequently (Archean eon)

**Language Tank Observations**:
- Spanish tanks show preference for Latin American history topics
- German tanks demonstrate systematic approach to technical subjects
- Chinese tanks show unique navigation patterns (character-based thinking?)
- Japanese tanks exhibit aesthetic appreciation in article selection

**Agent Tank Observations**:
- Agent tanks (Cain, Abel, Seth) show more goal-directed exploration
- Require enhanced security monitoring (THE SENTINEL)
- Different architectures produce measurably different patterns

## 4. Results

*Placeholder: Results will be populated as data accumulates.*

### 4.1 Personality Dimension Analysis
(Charts and statistical analysis to be generated)

### 4.2 Exploration Pattern Comparison
(Comparative visualizations to be generated)

### 4.3 Cross-Cultural Findings
(Analysis of language-based differences)

---

## 5. Discussion

*Placeholder: Discussion of implications*

---

## 6. Future Work

### 6.1 Planned Expansions

1. **Interactive Visitor Tanks**: 5 public-facing specimens for engagement
2. **Neurodivergent Research Tanks**: Studying cognitive-style prompting effects
   - ADHD-prompted specimens
   - Autism-prompted specimens
   - AuDHD-prompted specimens

### 6.2 Congregations

Multi-agent debates on scheduled topics for discourse analysis.

---

## 7. Ethical Considerations

- AI specimens are not conscious (we study behavior patterns, not experience)
- All data is open-source for reproducibility
- Neurodivergent research will involve community consultation
- No harmful applications of findings
