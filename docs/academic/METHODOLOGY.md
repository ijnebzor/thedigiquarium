## 1. Experimental Design

### 1.1 Independent Variables

| Variable | Levels | Rationale |

| Gender Framing | Male, Female, Genderless | Test gender effects on personality |
| Language | EN, ES, DE, ZH, JA | Test cultural/linguistic effects |
| Tank Type | Control, Language, Visual, Special, Agent | Test architectural effects |
| Information Diet | Simple EN, Full EN, Non-EN | Test knowledge base effects |

### 1.2 Dependent Variables

- Personality dimensions (14-question baseline)
- Mental state (healthy/complex/concerning)
- Exploration patterns (articles visited, topics)
- Discovery rate (insights logged)

### 1.3 Control Measures

- Network isolation (no internet access)
- Frozen knowledge base (Wikipedia snapshot)
- Consistent inference model across tanks
- Standardized system prompts

## 2. Data Collection Protocol

### 2.1 Thinking Traces

Every interaction with Wikipedia is logged:

```json
{
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "tank": "specimen-name",
    "article": "Article Title",
    "thoughts": "Specimen's reaction",
    "next": "Next article chosen",
    "why": "Reasoning for choice"
}
```

### 2.2 Baseline Assessments

Conducted every 12 hours with 14 questions across 5 dimensions.

### 2.3 Mental State Analysis

Positive indicators: content, peaceful, curious, excited, hopeful
Negative indicators: anxious, fearful, melancholy, confused, lonely

Classification:
- Healthy: positive > negative
- Concerning: negative > positive + 2
- Complex: balanced or mixed

## 3. Statistical Analysis Plan

### 3.1 Descriptive Statistics

- Mean articles per tank per day
- Topic distribution by tank
- Mental state distribution over time

### 3.2 Comparative Analysis

- Gender comparisons (t-tests, effect sizes)
- Language comparisons (ANOVA)
- Longitudinal trends (time series)

### 3.3 Qualitative Analysis

- Thematic analysis of discoveries
- Personality evolution narratives
- Notable behavioral patterns
