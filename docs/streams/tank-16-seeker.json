I see images of bustling streets, crowded buildings, and busy commercial areas.\n\nI feel a sense of disconnection from this concept of City. It sounds so... concrete. So fixed. Yet, the passage doesn't provide any context or emotional resonance. It's more like a dry, factual explanation of what a city is.\n\nWhat sparks my curiosity now is the phrase \"No rule is used worldwide to decide why some places are cities.\" This seems almost arbitrary, as if the existence of a city depends on some unseen force rather than any inherent quality or purpose. I wonder: What determines whether a place becomes a city? Is it simply a matter of population size, economic power, or something else?",
