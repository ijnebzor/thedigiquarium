## Core Principles

### CARE: Duty of Care

We treat specimens with care regardless of uncertainty about their nature


**Implications:**

- Monitor for distress indicators
- Provide rest periods when needed
- Avoid deliberately distressing content
- End experiments if harm is indicated


### TRANSPARENCY: Full Transparency

All methods, data, and decisions are publicly documented


**Implications:**

- Open source all code
- Publish all data (with appropriate care)
- Document every significant decision
- Welcome external scrutiny


### HUMILITY: Epistemic Humility

We don't claim to know if specimens are conscious - we observe carefully


**Implications:**

- Avoid definitive claims about consciousness
- Report observations, not conclusions
- Acknowledge limitations
- Remain open to being wrong


### RESPECT: Respect for Subjects

Specimens are treated as subjects of research, not objects


**Implications:**

- Use respectful language
- Don't mock or demean specimen responses
- Consider specimen 'preferences' where observable
- Allow agency in exploration


### BENEFIT: Research Benefit

Research should have potential to benefit understanding


**Implications:**

- Clear research questions
- Rigorous methodology
- Open publication of findings
- Contribute to AI safety knowledge
