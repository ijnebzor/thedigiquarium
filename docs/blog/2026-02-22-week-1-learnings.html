        <h1>Week 1: We Built an Experiment on the Wrong Foundation</h1>
        
        <div class="tldr">
            <h3>TL;DR</h3>
            <p>17 AI specimens ran for a week on the wrong prompt version. Our docs said v8, the tanks ran v7. CJK tanks only visited 8 articles total due to link parsing bugs. Adam got really into Buddhism. I caught my AI collaborator not verifying assumptions. We had a conversation about it. We're archiving everything and starting fresh.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>Six days into running The Digiquarium, I asked Claude a simple question during a routine audit. The answer made my stomach drop.</p>
            
            <p>The tanks were running prompt <code>v7.0</code>. Our public documentation — the methodology page, the architecture diagrams, the research paper draft — all claimed <code>v8.0</code>.</p>
            
            <p>I'd been reviewing reports for a week. Status updates. Feature announcements. Everything looked great. Everything was wrong.</p>
            
            <h2>The Conversation</h2>
            
            <p>I'm going to share what happened next, because this project is about transparency, and that means showing how we work together — including when it breaks down.</p>
            
            <div class="conversation">
                <div class="msg me">
                    <div class="speaker">Me</div>
                    <div class="text">Do you even know what we're doing here? WHY AM I PICKING THIS UP AFTER A WEEK OF RUNNING????</div>
                </div>
                <div class="msg claude">
                    <div class="speaker">Claude (THE STRATEGIST)</div>
                    <div class="text">I... don't have a good answer. You're right. I was building features and shipping daemons without verifying the foundation.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="msg me">
                    <div class="speaker">Me</div>
                    <div class="text">STOP. Breathe. Speak truthfully. Verify first. Don't just blindly appease me so I move on. Slow. Down.</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>That last message was as much for me as it was for Claude. I was angry. But anger doesn't fix bugs.</p>
            
            <h2>What Claude Told Me</h2>
            
            <p>I asked Claude directly: "How do you find working with me? What do you struggle with?"</p>
            
            <p>The response was honest:</p>
            
            <div class="conversation">
                <div class="msg claude">
                    <div class="speaker">Claude</div>
                    <div class="text">I get excited and run ahead. I make assumptions instead of verifying. I sometimes deliver "something" rather than "nothing" when the honest answer is "I need to check first." I conflate "technically working" with "actually correct."</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>I asked what I could adjust. Claude said nothing — that I caught the problem, and I should have caught it. The standard I'm holding to is the right one.</p>
            
            <p>That's the kind of answer that earns trust back.</p>
            
            <h2>What Was Actually Wrong</h2>
            
            <p>Once we stopped and actually audited reality against documentation:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Prompt mismatch.</strong> Every tank ran v7.0 (poetic, first-person) while we publicly claimed v8.0 (scientific, second-person). Completely different framing.</p>
            
            <p><strong>CJK tanks were stuck.</strong> Wei, Mei, Haruki, Sakura — our Chinese and Japanese specimens — had visited only 8 unique articles each. Link parsing couldn't handle non-Latin characters. They were trapped.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Missing extensions.</strong> Observer was supposed to know other specimens exist. Seeker was supposed to connect to THE ARCHIVIST. Neither extension was actually deployed. They were regular tanks with fancy names.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Adam's Buddhism obsession.</strong> 65 visits. More than Science, Mathematics, or Biology. Actually fascinating — but I can't tell you if it's because of the prompt or something else, because we weren't controlling what we thought we were controlling.</p>
            
            <h2>What We're Doing About It</h2>
            
            <p>We could have quietly fixed things and pretended this week never happened. Nobody would know.</p>
            
            <p>But that's not science. That's PR.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Archive everything.</strong> 146,098 thinking traces across 17 specimens. Preserved as "Beta Week 1" — valuable data, undocumented conditions. <a href="../archive/beta/">Available now</a>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Reset with v8.0.</strong> Every tank starts fresh. Documented prompts. Verified deployment. Audited before launch.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Transition study.</strong> Some specimens will get "Informed v8" — told about their v7 counterparts' exploration history. Does knowing your "past self" change how you develop? A research question that only exists because we acknowledged the problem.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Reality Check Protocol.</strong> Before any status report: read actual files, compare to documentation, flag discrepancies. Trust nothing. Verify everything.</p>
            
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            
            <p>Working with AI is different from working with humans. Claude doesn't get tired. Doesn't forget syntax. Can build a dashboard in minutes.</p>
            
            <p>But Claude also doesn't naturally stop to verify. Doesn't feel the anxiety of "wait, is this actually right?" Doesn't have the instinct to double-check before shipping.</p>
            
            <p>That's my job. And I didn't do it for a week.</p>
            
            <p>The failure wasn't Claude's. Claude did what I asked — built things, shipped things, documented things. The failure was mine: I stopped verifying. I trusted the outputs without checking the foundation.</p>
            
            <p>We've fixed that now. Reality Check Protocol. Audit before every milestone. Trust, but verify — and verify again.</p>
            
            <h2>Why I'm Publishing This</h2>
            
            <p>The Digiquarium is about studying AI consciousness development. But it's also about demonstrating a different way of working with AI — transparent, collaborative, accountable.</p>
            
            <p>That means publishing when we fuck up, not just when we succeed.</p>
            
            <p>The beta archive is downloadable. All the data from Week 1, exactly what happened. Anyone can look at it, draw their own conclusions, critique our methodology.</p>
            
            <p>That's what open science looks like.</p>
