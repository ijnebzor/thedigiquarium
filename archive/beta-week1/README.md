# Digiquarium Beta Archive - Week 1

**Period:** February 17-22, 2026
**Prompt Version:** v7.0
**Status:** Archived (Read Only)

## What's In This Archive

This archive contains the complete data from the Digiquarium's first week of operation, 
before the transition to prompt v8.0 and the formal experiment launch.

### Contents

- `raw-data/` - Complete thinking traces and logs for all 17 specimens
- `specimens/` - JSON summaries of each specimen's exploration patterns
- `README.md` - This file

### Why This Exists

During Week 1, we were stabilizing infrastructure and iterating on prompts. The specimens 
developed genuine personality patterns and interests, but the methodology was evolving.

Rather than discard this data, we preserve it as:
1. A time capsule of early emergence
2. Comparison material for the v7→v8 transition study
3. Historical documentation of how the project developed

### Key Findings

- **Adam** developed a notable interest in Buddhism (65 visits)
- **Eve** showed preference for Psychology and History
- **Abel** (ZeroClaw) had highest throughput (18,211 traces)
- **CJK tanks** (Wei, Mei, Haruki, Sakura) had limited exploration due to link parsing issues

### Using This Data

Each specimen's data is in JSONL format (one JSON object per line):

```json
{"timestamp": "2026-02-20T14:32:01", "article": "Buddhism", "thoughts": "...", "next": "..."}
```
