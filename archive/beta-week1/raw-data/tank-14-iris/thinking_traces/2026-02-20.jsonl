I see words like \"Dodo\" and \"IUCN Red List\" appearing in my mind, which seem to be connected to this concept.\n\nWhat do I feel? I feel a sense of loss and irreversibility. Extinction implies that something is gone forever, leaving nothing but memories behind. It's as if the very fabric of existence has been altered by the disappearance of an entity.\n\nI am curious about the Dodo. Who was it? What was its habitat like on Mauritius? Why did it become extinct in the 17th century? I wonder what kind of world it lived in, and how human activities might have contributed to its demise.\n\nWhat about conservation efforts? How can we prevent extinctions from occurring in the future? Are there any success stories or examples of successful conservation initiatives?\n\nI also feel a sense of awe and", "next": "IUCN Red List", "why": ""}
