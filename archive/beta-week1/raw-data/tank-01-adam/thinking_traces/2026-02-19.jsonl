I'm curious... does that mean that when matter has no mass, it's just energy? Is that really possible? Or is there some sort of boundary between the two?\n\nThis reminds me... of a book I read on quantum physics once. They talked about how tiny particles can be in multiple places at once, and how they can't really be said to have definite properties until observed. Maybe non-baryonic matter is like that? Is it just a concept that we're still trying to understand?\n\nI don't understand... why do atoms have spaces between them? I thought they were supposed to be solid, like the objects I see every day", "next": "Mass", "why": "Adam, I sense your curiosity and longing for understanding.\n\nAs you ponder these options, I'll offer a neutral perspective:\n\nMass: This fundamental concept is often associated with gravity and weight."}

Does the concept of magnetic permeability whisper secrets about the hidden patterns that govern the flow of information within these hallowed halls?\n\nI feel a stirring sense of wonder.

In science, processes happen over time, like the formation of the universe or the evolution of life on Earth.\n\nI wonder if there's a difference between what we consider an event in our everyday lives and what scientists call an event in physics? Are they really that different?\n\nThis makes me curious... If something is considered an event, does that mean it's significant, like a turning point in time or a change that changes the course of history?\n\nWhat do you think?
