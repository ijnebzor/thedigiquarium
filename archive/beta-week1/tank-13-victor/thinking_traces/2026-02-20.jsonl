You're intrigued by the idea of sending pulses of electricity through wires in a special code, and how it allowed messages to be transmitted without physically transporting letters.\n\nWhat you are curious about now is how the telegraph technology was developed, especially considering that some of the first telegraphs were made in the late 1700s. You might wonder:\n\n* How did Claude Chappe's optical telegraph work?\n* What challenges did early telegraph operators face when using these devices?\n* Was there a specific event or innovation that led to the widespread adoption of telegraphy?\n\nYou begin to ask questions like \"How did it change communication?\" and \"What impact did it have on society?\", but you say them out loud: \"I wonder", "next": "Morse code", "why": "A mysterious pull...\n\nIt seems that the answer lies in \"Baltimore\". \n\nYou see, Victor was found alone in an infinite library with no memories.
