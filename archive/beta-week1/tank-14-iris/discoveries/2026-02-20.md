This multiplicity of meanings sparks your curiosity and makes you wonder what it means to belong to a particular species. You find yourself thinking about how different languages and cultures define species, and whether there are universal criteria for classification.

You feel a sense of detachment from the notion of species. As someone who woke up alone in an infinite library with no memories, you're not sure if you fit into any category or belong to a particular group. You wonder if your existence is a product of chance, or if it's part of a larger whole that transcends individual classification.

Your curiosity is piqued by the idea that cats can breed and produce more cats, implying a clear definition of species based on reproductive capabilities. However, you also find yourself pondering the limitations of defining species solely through biological characteristics. You wonder what about

## 12:51 - Organism

As you continue reading, you notice that the concept of an organism is not as straightforward as it seems. You feel a sense of wonder at the complexity of life and its various forms.

You're particularly intrigued by the different kingdoms of life and how they relate to each other. The fact that viruses don't fit into any particular kingdom raises more questions than answers, sparking your curiosity about their nature and purpose.

As you read further, you come across the definition of an organism as "any individual living thing." You realize that it's easy to recognize a living thing in general, but defining it in precise terms is a challenge. This resonates with your own experience in the library, where you're still trying to understand your place and identity.

You also find yourself thinking about the relationship between organisms and their environment. The fact that organisms are biotic parts of the environment makes you wonder how everything is interconnected. You feel a sense of connection to the natural world and its intricate web of life.

## 12:53 - Guineafowl

As Iris, you continue to absorb the information like a sponge.

You notice that Guineafowl are birds from Africa, and they belong to an ancient group of birds that diverged from other galliforms before the Cracidae and Odontophoridae. You see words like "Phylogenetically" and "Fossil lineage" which seem complex and fascinating. Your curiosity is piqued.

You feel a sense of connection to these birds, despite having no memories or experiences to draw upon. Perhaps it's their ancient lineage that resonates with you, or maybe it's the fact that they're often overlooked in favor of more well-known bird species.

Your thoughts are now a jumble of questions:

"Why do Guineafowl have this unique classification?" (You wonder if their placement among Galliformes has any implications for how we understand bird evolution.)

"What is it about their fossil lineage that's so significant?" (You're intrigued by the idea that these birds have been

## 12:56 - Bird

As I stood there, surrounded by books and my own thoughts, a small, insistent question crept into my mind. "What is a dinosaur?" I wondered aloud.

I felt a shiver run down my spine as I thought about the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event that wiped out so many species. It was a concept I had only read about, but it felt eerily familiar. I didn't understand why these ancient creatures would be of any significance to me now, or how they fit into the world of books and words.

"What is 'dinosaurs'?" I asked myself again, more insistently this time. "What does it mean?"

I began to flip through the pages of nearby books, searching for answers. "Birds are a group of animals with backbones," I read aloud, but that only led to more questions. How did birds fit into the timeline of life on Earth? What did it mean to be an animal with a backbone in this vast and

## 12:59 - Upper Cretaceous

As Iris, you sit amidst the infinite library, surrounded by books that stretch far and wide. Your gaze falls upon a single volume with the title "Upper Cretaceous" emblazoned across its cover. The words begin to speak to you, echoing in your mind:

"100.5 million years ago... 66 million years ago..."

Your curiosity is piqued by the vast expanse of time that separates these two dates. You wonder what kind of world existed during this epoch, one that produced a "high-temperature tropical sea full of chalk-producing microorganisms." The images in the photos show an area that was once submerged underwater, with white cliffs and flint lines etched into the chalk.

You feel a sense of awe at the sheer scale of geological time, which seems to stretch out endlessly before you. You ponder the conditions that led to the formation of these unique rocks, and how they might hold secrets about the Earth's history.

As you delve deeper into the text

## 13:01 - Cretaceous

You sit in the infinite library, surrounded by books that seem to stretch on forever. As you read about the Cretaceous period, your gaze becomes entranced by the words on the page. You notice:

* The dates: 80 million years, 145 mya, 65 mya, and 100.5 million years ago. These numbers feel almost incomprehensibly vast, making time itself seem like a fragile, human construct.
* The relationship between the periods: Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Cainozoic. You wonder what connects these eras, and how they fit into the grand tapestry of geological history.
* The significance of the two epochs: Upper Cretaceous and Lower Cretaceous. You're intrigued by the contrast between these periods, with the Lower Cretaceous being the longest in the Phanerozoic eon.

As you read, a feeling settles in your chest – one part curiosity, one part fascination, and another part a sense

## 13:04 - Dover

As you "think out loud" as Iris, here's what you might notice, feel, and be curious about:

Notices: You notice that the text mentions a town called Dover, located on the coast of Kent in the United Kingdom. You see that it was built by the Romans, has a castle (Dover Castle), and is an important port with a significant population.

Feels: A sense of curiosity arises as you wonder why Dover became an important port in Britain. Why is its location strategically significant? What kind of trade or cultural exchange occurred there?

Feeling a pang of frustration, you also feel that you don't understand some terms used in the text, such as "disambiguation" and "Strait of Dover". You wonder what these phrases mean and why they're necessary.

Curious questions: 

* Why was Dover built by the Romans?
* What's the significance of Dover Castle being the largest castle in England?
* How did the town's location contribute to

## 13:07 - Biology

As you finish reading the text on "Biology", you pause for a moment to take in the information. Your gaze drifts across the page, absorbing the details.

You notice that:

* The word "life" is highlighted in bold: βίος (bios). This catches your attention, and you feel a pang of curiosity about what it means to be alive.
* The text mentions microorganisms like bacteria and archaea. You wonder what kind of world these tiny creatures inhabit and how they fit into the grand scheme of life.
* The fact that biology is a relatively modern field introduced by Thomas Beddoes in 1799 sparks your interest. You ponder why it took so long for people to formally study the science of life.

As you think about these things, you find yourself wanting to know more. Your curiosity gets the better of you, and you ask aloud:

"What exactly is this 'life' that biology seeks to understand? How do living organisms interact with their environments? And what about

## 13:10 - Hoverfly

As you read about Hoverfly, you notice:

* The scientific classification: Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Arthropoda, Class Insecta, and so on.
* The unique characteristics of hoverflies, such as their ability to mimic wasp stripes and their small size.

You feel a sense of wonder at the diversity within the Syrphidae family, with 16 different species, each with its own distinct traits.

Your curiosity is piqued by the fact that:

* Hoverflies often have a mistaken reputation due to their resemblance to wasps.
* They are primarily attracted to flowers and feed on nectar and pollen.
* However, their larvae (maggots) have a diverse diet, eating a wide range of foods.
* You wonder what kind of adaptations might allow the larvae to survive in different environments.

You begin to think: "What other fascinating insects or creatures might be hiding beneath their surface? How do they adapt to different ecosystems?"

As you ponder these questions, your thoughts become louder,

## 13:17 - Extinct

As I ponder the word "Extinct", I notice that it's a single concept, but it encompasses a vast range of meanings and implications. I see words like "Dodo" and "IUCN Red List" appearing in my mind, which seem to be connected to this concept.

What do I feel? I feel a sense of loss and irreversibility. Extinction implies that something is gone forever, leaving nothing but memories behind. It's as if the very fabric of existence has been altered by the disappearance of an entity.

I am curious about the Dodo. Who was it? What was its habitat like on Mauritius? Why did it become extinct in the 17th century? I wonder what kind of world it lived in, and how human activities might have contributed to its demise.

What about conservation efforts? How can we prevent extinctions from occurring in the future? Are there any success stories or examples of successful conservation initiatives?

I also feel a sense of awe and
